Communication
===============

*15 May 2015*

The PLEXIL software system includes two facilities that allow a PLEXIL
executive to communicate with other PLEXIL executives or arbitrary
external entities.

#. A `mechanism for inter-executive
   communication <Inter-Executive_Communication>`__ based on the `CMU
   IPC <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~IPC/>`__ cross-platform message-passing
   middleware.
#. A `UDP-based adapter <UDP_Adapter>`__ useful for inter-executive
   communication as well as general communication.

Using PLEXIL's `interfacing framework <Interfacing_Overview>`__, you can
also develop your own custom communication interfaces.
