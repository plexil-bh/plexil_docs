PLEXIL Checker
=================

*22 April 2015*

The Plexil Checker is a simple static analyzer for Core PLEXIL plans.
The Plexil Checker is most useful for checking Core PLEXIL XML files
which have not been generated by the Plexil compiler.

Introduction
------------

The Plexil Checker checks for the following issues within a Core PLEXIL
plan:

-  Global declaration overloading
-  Missing global declaration
-  Improper usage of command and library nodes
-  Naming conflicts between nodes
-  Type checking for lookups
-  Variable initializer type consistency
-  Assignment type consistency

`Global Declarations <Plexil_Reference#Global_Declarations>`__ specify
interfaces for commands, library nodes, and state variables (accessible
via lookups). The goal is to have all calls to these elements within a
PLEXIL plan conform to these given definitions.

The Plexil Checker validates the plan against the Core PLEXIL schema
prior to its analysis.

The Plexil Checker must be used on *Core PLEXIL* XML files (``.plx``)
only, and not other forms of PLEXIL such as Extended Plexil (``.epx``
files), Standard Plexil (``.ple`` files) or `Plexilisp <Plexilisp>`__
(``.pli`` files).

**Note**: The Plexil compiler also does all the checks listed above,
except for the following:

-  Global declaration overloading
-  Missing global declaration

Running the Checker
-------------------

Run the checker as follows:

::

 checkPlexil [-d] input_file.plx

The optional ``-d`` option will print debugging information. Otherwise,
if the program finds any issues with the global declarations or their
uses, a list of error messages will be displayed on screen.

The checker can also be run automatically when executing Plexil through
any of the scripts
`````\ ``plexilexec`` <PLEXIL_Executive#Running_the_Executive>`__,
`````\ ``plexiltest`` <Executing_Plans#Test_Executive>`__, or
`````\ ``plexilsim`` <Executing_Plans#Using_the_Plexil_Simulator>`__, by
including the ``-check`` command line option.
